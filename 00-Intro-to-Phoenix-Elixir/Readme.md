# Intro to Phoenix & Elixir

We will be building a backend API in Phoenix, the web framework that allows us to handle network requests. But first we must learn a little bit of Elixir, the language that we will be writing our backend API with.

## History of Elixir and Functional Programming

Elixir comes from a background of computer languages that emphasize functional programming, a type of programming that relies on the purity of functions, using value types instead of reference types.

Swift is a multi-paradim language. It has both value type and reference types. But the Swift standard library itself is writting with mostly value types (Structs, Protocols and Enums).

Functional programming can be immensly useful and has been proven to help problems at gigantic scale, especially with distributed systems.

Elixir was built in 2011 by Jose Valim. He wanted to build a language and framework that was easy to use without any of the performance hits.

Elixir is built on the Erlang Virtual Machine.
