# iOS103 - End-to-End iOS Development

## Course Overview

In this course, we will be developing an iOS app but first building our own small API to interface with! Through the course, we will focus on a small core subset of features that will help you be come a successful iOS developer. 

Knowing the complete cycle of developing backend systems to client interfaces is crucial to building any internet product or service.

It also helps you understand how these systems are built from the ground up and how to get your own API up and running!

For the backend, we will build a small Phoenix app with a postgres database. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with any of those. This course will introduce you to the fundamentals of the language (Elixir) and the framework (Phoenix).

## Objectives & Competencies

1. Learn how the request response cycle works
2. Build a two resource API
3. Interface with the API with an iOS client  to login, signup and fetch data.
4. Learn the basics of functional programming and techniques like recursion.
